## NW-HW-06-WEATHER-DASHBOARD

## DESCRIPTION

Homework #6 in Northwestern's coding bootcamp asks us to contstruct a webpage that utilizes a weather API in order to retrieve current-day weather conditions, as well as a projection of the next 5 days' weather given a user's input of a city. The application also retrieves user previously logged input from local storage to retrieve data for a previously queried city.
